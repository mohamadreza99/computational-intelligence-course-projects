## Adults Income Prediction
in this project, I used well-known [adults](https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset.php?cod=192#sub1) dataset. 


The Adult data set was extracted in 1994 from census data of the United States. It contains continuous and nominal attributes, describing some social information (age, race, sex, marital status, ...) about the citizens registered.

The task is to predict whether the citizenâ€™s income exceeds fifty thousand dollars a year.

I implemented SVM algorithm with the help of sklearn library. in another implementation, I implemented KNN algorithm without the aid of any library or pre-written function.

A html file in the directory of this project exists that shows dataset characteristics and one can use it for EDA purposes. How to generate this file is demonstrated in the notebook.
